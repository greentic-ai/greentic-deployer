# PR-28: Document future adapters + reference flows for HTTP/MQTT

## Goal
Make it easy for pack authors to design installer behavior that works across adapters.

## Scope
Docs + fixtures.

## Changes
- Add `docs/platform_bootstrap_adapters.md`:
  - CLI / JSON / HTTP / MQTT behavior
  - policy flags and security defaults
  - topic/endpoint conventions
- Add fixture examples:
  - installer schema with multi-step wizard
  - MQTT schema publish example
  - HTTP endpoints example

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docs are consistent with code and flags.
- Fixtures are used by at least one test (smoke test).

## Tests
- Smoke tests for parsing fixture flows.

## Notes
- This PR is documentation and test-fixture heavy; keep it clean and readable.
