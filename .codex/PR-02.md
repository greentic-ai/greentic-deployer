# PR-02: Add bootstrap block to pack manifest types (backward-compatible)

## Goal
Support manifest-level bootstrap conventions so deployer does not rely on filename guessing.

## Scope
Additive schema/types change only.

## Changes
- Extend pack manifest model to support optional:
  ```yaml
  bootstrap:
    install_flow: platform_install
    upgrade_flow: platform_upgrade
    installer_component: installer
Ensure the block is optional; absence preserves existing behavior.

Update docs (README or pack spec doc) with the new field and examples.

Acceptance Criteria

Existing packs without bootstrap still parse and behave identically.

Packs with bootstrap parse successfully and expose the fields.

Tests

Add fixture pack YAML without bootstrap parses OK.

Add fixture pack YAML with bootstrap parses OK.

Roundtrip serialize/deserialize (if applicable) keeps bootstrap fields.

Notes

Do not introduce any deployer logic yet; only types + docs + tests.
