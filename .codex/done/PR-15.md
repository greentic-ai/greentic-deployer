# PR-15: Apply config_patch and generate deploy plan (reuse existing deployment logic)

## Goal
Turn validated bootstrap outputs into a deterministic install plan, reusing deployer’s existing deployment logic.

## Scope
Config patch apply + plan creation; no upgrade logic yet.

## Changes
- Apply `config_patch` to a target config location (policy-controlled):
  - local: `/etc/greentic/config.toml` (example) or bootstrap dir
- Convert outputs into a deploy plan invocation (existing machinery).
- Mark state “installed” only after successful plan apply.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Install flow outputs lead to platform components being deployed.
- Bootstrap state updated only on success.

## Tests
- Integration test: fixture pack -> config_patch -> plan -> success updates state.

## Notes
- Do not require platform services to already be running.
