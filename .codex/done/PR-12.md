# PR-12: Implement CLI interaction adapter (deployer side)

## Goal
Enable interactive prompting via deployer while installer controls UX/questions.

## Scope
CLI adapter only; installer defines questions schema.

## Changes
- Implement CLI adapter that can:
  - display questions provided by installer (schema-driven)
  - collect answers
  - return answers to installer for validation/normalization
- Ensure policy flags can disable CLI prompts (e.g., automation mode).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `platform install --interaction cli` runs through question/answer loop.
- Answers are validated by installer; invalid answers reprompt or fail clearly.

## Tests
- Unit test CLI adapter schema rendering.
- Integration test with scripted stdin (if supported) or JSON-mode fallback for tests.

## Notes
- Do not hardcode any questions in deployer.
