# PR-14: Secrets intent execution via secrets-store (bootstrap-safe)

## Goal
Installer emits intent; deployer executes writes using secrets-store interface.

## Scope
File backend first; others pluggable.

## Changes
- Add `--secrets-backend` flag:
  - `file:/var/lib/greentic/secrets.db` (default)
  - (future) `k8s:...`
- Implement execution of `secrets_writes[]` via `greentic:secrets-store`.
- Ensure secrets are never printed unless explicitly requested (e.g., `--debug` with redaction).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Secrets are written to chosen backend.
- BootstrapOutput persistence does not leak secrets.

## Tests
- File-backend secrets store integration test.
- Redaction test for logs/output.

## Notes
- Keep secrets interface stable; no bespoke backend logic in deployer core.
