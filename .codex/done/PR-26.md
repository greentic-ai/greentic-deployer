# PR-26: Bootstrap networking posture: explicit allowlists for outbound network

## Goal
Prevent accidental network access during bootstrap even when network is enabled.

## Scope
Policy enhancements + enforcement hooks.

## Changes
- Add:
  - `--allow-network` (already referenced in your principles)
  - `--net-allowlist <csv>` (domains/IP ranges)
- Enforce allowlist in any bootstrap step that attempts outbound calls:
  - adapters (MQTT broker)
  - OCI resolver (future)
  - any tool node that uses networking (if ever allowed)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Network attempts outside allowlist fail fast with clear errors.
- Offline-only always wins over allow-network.

## Tests
- Unit tests: allowlist parsing.
- Integration test: blocked broker connection when not allowlisted.

## Notes
- This keeps “offline-first” true even in mixed environments.
