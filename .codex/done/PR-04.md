# PR-04: Deployer: gtpack local resolver for platform commands

## Goal
Make platform commands load `.gtpack` from local disk (USB path), offline-first.

## Scope
Implement local pack loading only; no execution yet.

## Changes
- Add `--pack <path>` handling that:
  - Validates the file exists and is readable.
  - Opens the gtpack using existing pack reader APIs.
  - Extracts and loads `pack.yaml`.
- Wire resolver into `platform install` / `platform upgrade` commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `platform install --pack ./x.gtpack` loads pack metadata and prints:
  - pack name
  - version
  - digest (if available)
- Clear error messages on missing/invalid pack.

## Tests
- Add a small fixture gtpack (or build one in test) and verify resolver behavior.
- Negative tests: missing file / invalid format.

## Notes
- No OCI support in this PR.
