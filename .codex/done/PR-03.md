# PR-03: Deployer: add platform command skeleton (no behavior change yet)

## Goal
Introduce CLI surface area for platform bootstrap without implementing execution yet.

## Scope
CLI scaffolding only.

## Changes
- Add top-level commands:
  - `greentic-deployer platform install --pack <path.gtpack>`
  - `greentic-deployer platform upgrade --pack <path.gtpack>`
  - `greentic-deployer platform status`
- Ensure commands return "not implemented" with clear messaging and non-zero exit codes where appropriate.
- Add help text mentioning offline-first + bootstrap state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `--help` shows the new commands.
- Existing deployer commands unchanged.
- No new dependencies required.

## Tests
- CLI snapshot / golden tests if repo has them; otherwise simple unit test for arg parsing.

## Notes
- Keep this PR tiny: routing + help text only.
