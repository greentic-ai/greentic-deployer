# PR-07: Flow loader: resolve install/upgrade flow from manifest (with fallback)

## Goal
Select the correct bootstrap flow deterministically using `pack.yaml bootstrap` fields.

## Scope
Read-only resolution logic; no execution yet.

## Changes
- Implement:
  - resolve install flow id/name:
    - prefer `pack.bootstrap.install_flow`
    - fallback to `platform_install` (as per convention)
  - resolve upgrade flow id/name:
    - prefer `pack.bootstrap.upgrade_flow`
    - fallback to `platform_upgrade`
  - resolve installer component name:
    - prefer `pack.bootstrap.installer_component`
    - fallback to `installer`
- Validate that referenced flow exists in gtpack.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Packs with explicit bootstrap fields resolve correctly.
- Packs without bootstrap fields resolve via default conventions.

## Tests
- Fixture pack with explicit bootstrap block.
- Fixture pack without bootstrap block.
- Missing referenced flow => clear error.

## Notes
- Still no flow execution.
