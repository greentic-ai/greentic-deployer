# PR-08: Deployer: minimal bootstrap flow execution engine (pre-platform)

## Goal
Execute `platform_install.ygtc` / `platform_upgrade.ygtc` in deployer before platform exists.

## Scope
Support a minimal subset sufficient for bootstrap: prompt/validate/emit outputs.

## Changes
- Add a “bootstrap flow runner” that can:
  - load ygtc
  - execute nodes that are allowed in bootstrap mode
- Add a bootstrap-mode restriction list (deny everything by default):
  - allow: installer component calls + pure transforms/validation steps
  - deny: network calls, long-running services, runtime deploy nodes (for now)
- Flow runner returns structured output object (see PR-09).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `platform install` loads and runs the bootstrap flow (even if installer is stubbed).
- Denied nodes fail with a clear message: “not allowed in bootstrap mode”.

## Tests
- Minimal ygtc fixture that calls installer once and returns output.
- Fixture with forbidden node => fails.

## Notes
- Keep this engine minimal; reuse existing flow infra if available.
