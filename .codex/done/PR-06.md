# PR-06: Deployer: bootstrap state store (read/write, pre-platform)

## Goal
Persist bootstrap state outside the platform so it is readable before Greentic exists.

## Scope
Local filesystem state store (default). No k8s state yet.

## Changes
- Add `bootstrap/state.rs` with:
  - `BootstrapState` struct (version, digest, timestamps, env_kind, last_upgrade, rollback_ref)
  - load/save functions
- Default path: `/var/lib/greentic/bootstrap/state.json` (override via flag/env):
  - `--bootstrap-state <path>`
- `platform status` reads and prints the state (or "not installed").

## Acceptance Criteria
- `platform status` works even if platform not installed (prints empty state).
- `install/upgrade` updates state only after success (later PRs will define “success”).

## Tests
- Unit tests for state read/write + schema compatibility.
- Test: missing state file -> returns “not installed”.

## Notes
- No secrets stored here.
