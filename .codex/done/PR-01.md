# PR-01: Add platform bootstrap spec + glossary

## Goal
Lock the Greentic Platform Bootstrap & Installer Architecture as the authoritative in-repo spec to prevent design drift.

## Scope
Docs only. No runtime behavior changes.

## Changes
- Add `docs/platform_bootstrap.md` containing the full spec (copy verbatim from the agreed architecture).
- Add `docs/platform_bootstrap_glossary.md`:
  - gtpack
  - platform pack
  - bootstrap vs runtime
  - platform_install.ygtc / platform_upgrade.ygtc
  - installer.wasm
  - capability negotiation
  - bootstrap state
  - config_patch vs secrets_writes

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docs render correctly in repo viewer.
- No changes to build/test outputs.

## Tests
- None (docs-only).

## Notes
- This PR is intentionally non-code to anchor all subsequent PR decisions.
