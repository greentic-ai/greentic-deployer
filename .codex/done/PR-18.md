# PR-18: Reference platform pack + sample platform_install.ygtc (docs/fixtures)

## Goal
Provide a working reference pack + flows for developers and CI.

## Scope
Fixtures + docs, not production packs.

## Changes
- Add `fixtures/platform-pack/` containing:
  - `pack.yaml` with bootstrap block
  - `flows/platform_install.ygtc` (minimal but realistic)
  - `flows/platform_upgrade.ygtc`
  - stub `installer.wasm` (if not already in fixtures)
- Add `docs/platform_bootstrap_example.md` explaining:
  - CLI mode install
  - JSON mode install
  - air-gapped workflow example commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- CI can run an end-to-end “bootstrap install” integration test against fixtures.
- Developers can copy the example to build real platform packs.

## Tests
- Add an integration test running:
  - `platform install` with JSON answers against fixture pack.

## Notes
- This is the canonical example used for future interaction modes (HTTP/MQTT later).
