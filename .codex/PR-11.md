# PR-11: Add installer.wasm stub component + bootstrap call wiring

## Goal
Prove end-to-end flow execution can call installer component as a WASM module.

## Scope
Minimal WASM host + stubbed installer that returns a fixed schema/output.

## Changes
- Add a minimal `installer` component contract:
  - `get_supported_modes()`
  - `run(mode, input) -> BootstrapOutput`
- Add a stub `installer.wasm` example (or test fixture) that:
  - supports CLI + JSON
  - returns a deterministic output with `ready=true`

## Acceptance Criteria
- A sample `platform_install.ygtc` can call installer and receive output.
- Deployer prints BootstrapOutput.

## Tests
- Integration test: run platform install against fixture pack with stub installer.

## Notes
- Keep the installer stub tiny and deterministic.
