# PR-23: Adapter reliability: timeouts, retries, and deterministic status events

## Goal
Make interactive modes robust, debuggable, and automation-friendly.

## Scope
Shared adapter utilities.

## Changes
- Add standard statuses for bootstrap interaction:
  - `waiting_for_answers`
  - `validating`
  - `writing_secrets`
  - `applying_config`
  - `deploying`
  - `completed` / `failed`
- Add:
  - configurable timeout `--interaction-timeout`
  - retry policy for network adapters (bounded)
- Ensure status updates are surfaced:
  - CLI: progress lines
  - JSON: final output includes status
  - HTTP/MQTT: status endpoint/topic updated

## Acceptance Criteria
- All adapters emit consistent status transitions.
- On failure, users get actionable error messages and the last status.

## Tests
- Unit tests for status state machine.
- Integration tests that validate expected status sequence in fixture installs.

## Notes
- Keep logging redacted for secrets across all adapters.
