# PR-27: OCI resolver for platform packs (optional, policy-gated)

## Goal
Allow `--pack oci://...` as a future-friendly option while remaining offline-first by default.

## Scope
Optional feature; must require network enablement and allowlists.

## Changes
- Extend `--pack` to accept:
  - local path
  - `oci://registry/repo:tag`
- Enforce:
  - requires `--allow-network`
  - requires allowlist match for registry host
- Cache downloaded pack under bootstrap dir with digest naming.
- Verify signatures/digests as in PR-05.

## Acceptance Criteria
- OCI pack fetch works when explicitly enabled.
- Defaults remain local-only.

## Tests
- Unit tests for URL parsing + policy gating.
- Integration tests mocked (no real network in CI).

## Notes
- Still deterministic: cached by digest; installs from cache afterward.
